# High Lift Prediction Workshop 6 - Template Submission Files

This folder contains four files participants are expected to modify and submit for Test Case 1:

1. **FM.dat** = Converged or time-averaged Force and Moment data vs. angle of attack, multiple grid levels may be included
   - N.B.: append grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids
3. **gridconvergence\_FM.dat** =  Converged or time-averaged Force and Moment data vs. grid level, multiple angles of attack may be included (this is a transpose of #1)
4. **nominalgrid\_cpcf.dat** = Surface pressure and skin friction distributions at locations corresponding to experimental pressure belts. These are defined [here](https://aiaa-hlpw.org/assets/HLPW6/tc1/TC1_Pressure_Rows.xlsx)
   - N.B.: remove nominal grid, add grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids
6. **nominalgrid\_iterative.dat** = Solver iterative convergence with respect to iteration, or if time-dependent, with respect to convective time
   - N.B.: remove nominal grid, add grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids

Additionally, participants should revise the Readme.md (this file) within their submission directory to include the following data:
