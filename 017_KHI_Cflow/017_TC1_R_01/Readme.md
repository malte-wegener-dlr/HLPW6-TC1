# High Lift Prediction Workshop 6 - Template Submission Files

This folder contains No.1. and 3. files of the followings:

1. **FM.dat** = Converged or time-averaged Force and Moment data vs. angle of attack, multiple grid levels may be included
   - N.B.: append grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids
3. **gridconvergence\_FM.dat** =  Converged or time-averaged Force and Moment data vs. grid level, multiple angles of attack may be included (this is a transpose of #1)
4. **nominalgrid\_cpcf.dat** = Surface pressure and skin friction distributions at locations corresponding to experimental pressure belts. These are defined here: <insert link to distribution definition>
   - N.B.: remove nominal grid, add grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids
6. **nominalgrid\_iterative.dat** = Solver iterative convergence with respect to iteration, or if time-dependent, with respect to convective time
   - N.B.: remove nominal grid, add grid descriptor if providing results for multiple grids

Additionally, participants should revise the Readme.md (this file) within their submission directory to include the following data:

# SOLVER INFORMATION:

## Solver Name and Version:
Cflow, cflow-solv.5.10.12

## Basic Algorithm:  
Unstructured Navier-Stokes solver, Cell-centered finite volume method  

## Turbulence Model:  
SA-neg  

## Transition Method:
none (fully turbulent)  

## Convergence Criteria:
Eyeball and Cflow method (\*)  
(\*) Based on the gradient of CL and CD.  
CL does not change 0.01 within 2FT, CD does not change 0.001 within 2 FT.  
FT=2 Flow Through MAC based on averaged time step.  
(Some cases does not satisfy this criteria in this version.)
